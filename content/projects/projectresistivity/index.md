##### Summary

We study magnetic reconnection using 2D resistivity magnetohydrodynamics simulations and found that fast reconnection can be achieved by a resistivity gradient in the outflow direction. We also tested how the reconnection rate increases with increasing resistivity and found that current density decreases significantly at the X-line.

##### Abstract

Using two-dimensional (2D) magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we show that Petschek-type magnetic reconnection can be induced using a simple resistivity gradient in the reconnection outflow direction, revealing the key ingredient of steady fast reconnection in the collisional limit. We find that the diffusion region self-adjusts its half-length to fit the given gradient scale of resistivity. The induced reconnection x-line and flow stagnation point always reside within the resistivity transition region closer to the higher resistivity end. The opening of one exhaust by this resistivity gradient will lead to the opening of the other exhaust located on the other side of the x-line, within the region of uniform resistivity. Potential applications of this setup to reconnection-based thrusters and solar spicules are discussed. In a separate set of numerical experiments, we explore the maximum plausible reconnection rate using a large and spatially localized resistivity right at the x-line. Interestingly, the resulting current density at the x-line drops significantly so that the normalized reconnection rate remains bounded by the value $\simeq 0.2$‚Å†, consistent with the theoretical prediction.
